# chatbuilder

If you followed the instructions explicitly, you would end up with a version of chatbuilder such that 
every time the page called the fetch/display commands, ALL of the posts would be displayed. Not just
the new ones.

I've changed the code such that only the new posts are posted.

TODO: 

1. ~~Filter out the RoboChat so I can see meaningfull messages. (If I leave Borken Chat on in the background,
I should be able to see anyone who attempted to make the project (and succeeded)).~~
1. ~~a) Created show/hide button to show and hide robo-chat.~~

2. ~~Create a new database on Parse for me to use with my friends instead of posting it to the world on
hack reactor's parse db.~~

3. ~~Create some nice CSS styling so that it looks a bit better.~~
4. ~~Add word count next to send button. Should not allow user to send if wordcount is more than 140 or if wordcount is 0.~~
5. Hashtags
    a. Add auto highlighting to anything with a hashtag
    b. search field to look for hashtags and change list
    c.
